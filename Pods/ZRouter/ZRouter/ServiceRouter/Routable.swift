/**
 Entry for routable service protocol, only available for explicitly declared protocol.
 
 Declare that protocol `TestServiceInput` is routable as a service protocol:
 ```
 extension RoutableService where Protocol == TestServiceInput {
     init() { self.init(declaredProtocol: Protocol.self) }
 }
 ```
 The Protocol can also be composed type, like:
 ```
 ServiceType & TestServiceInput
 ```
 or
 ```
 TestServiceInput & AnotherServiceInput
 ```
  When a type is declared as routable, you should register it in router's `registerRoutableDestiantion()`. In DEBUG mode, ZRouter will enumerate all declared type and make sure they are all registered.
 - Warning
 Never add extension for RoutableServiceModule without generic constraint and expose its initializer.

// MARK: Invalid Check

/// When using ZRouter as dynamic framework, these symbols should never be linked in your code, if linked, that means you are using some undeclared type as generic parameter of RoutableService / RoutableServiceModule.

/* Invalid usage of RoutableService. Don't use an object type as generic parameter of RoutableService:
 ```
 @objc protocol SomeServiceProtocol: ZIKServiceRoutable {

 // There is a class conforms to ZIKServiceRoutable
 class SomeClassType: NSObject, SomeServiceProtocol {
 
 }
 ```
 ```
 // Invalid usage, can't get router with it
 RoutableService<SomeClassType>()
 ```
 You should use the protocol to get its router, although the compiler won't give error when `SomeClassType` is used as generic parameter of RoutableService. These invalid usages will be detected when registration is finished.
 
 If it's hard to find out the bad code, you can use `Hopper Disassembler` to analyze your app and see references to this symbol:
